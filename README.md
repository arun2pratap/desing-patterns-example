4. Command Pattern
5. CommandMC command pattern exmaple Monte Carlo
6. Composite Design Pattern [file/directory example]
    a. Training Course - design problem
        /* This application is concerned with training courses.
         * A course has a title, a fee and a list of sessions. However,
         * sometimes a course can consist of several modules, each of which is a
         * course. For example, there may be a compound course "Fast track to
         * becoming a web developer" which consists of three modules: a course
         * named "HTML", a course named "FrontPage" and a course named "Flash".
         * It is possible for a module to consist of some other modules.
         * If a course consists of modules, its fee and schedule are totally
         * determined by that of its modules and thus it will not maintain
         * its list of sessions.
         * Point out and remove the code smells in the code */

7. Iterator Pattern [map reduce example]
